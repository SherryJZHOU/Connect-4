# Connect4
In the basic game, the board is made up of six rows and seven columns, which are filled with tokens. 
Players take turns dropping tokens into vertical columns until one player has 4-in-a-row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) or the board is full.

An online version of the orginial game is here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html

This version of the Connect game has 3 major differences from the basic game. First, the size of the game board will not be limited to the default. Second, games may start with one or more obstacle pieces already on the board which do not belong to either player. Lastly, play will always continue until the board is completely full even after a player has achieved 4-in-a-row, at which point scores for each player will be calculated.
